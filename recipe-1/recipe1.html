        <h2>What is Roti John?</h2>
        <p>Some have said that roti John was first originated in Singapore back in the 60s. Roti is a general term for bread or anything that is bread-based or flatbread in Hindi, Malay, and Bahasa. How about John you would ask? Well, John is definitely a caucasian name and usually, a general ‚Äúterm‚Äù used to describe any caucasian male. Roti John is a fusion between the East and West cultures in a form of sandwich üôÇ Story goes that roti John was born when an Englishman asked a street food vendor to make him a hamburger. He described to him how a hamburger supposed to be like and with that description, the guy made him with what he had, which were baguette, mutton, eggs, onion, ketchup, and chili sauce. He then presented the so-called hamburger to the guy and said ‚ÄúSilakan (please) makan (eat) roti (referring to the hamburger), John (general term for caucasian male)‚Äù.
