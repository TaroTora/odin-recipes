        <h2>Golden Fried Rice</h2>
        <p>Golden Fried Rice (huángjīn chǎofàn – 黄金炒饭) gets its name from the fact that you coat the rice in egg yolk before stir-frying. 

            It has a luxurious golden color and a pronounced rich and eggy aroma. Add an extra pinch of salt to really make it shine. It’s subtle but so flavorful! </p>
